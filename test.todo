I am creating a web app that generates fake data for testing and devlopement purposes. The user can create a schema of the model of data that they need and my app generates bunch of data based on that schema. It is like faker api but here the user can define the schema, get as much data as they want, can specify the types of data they want. create a react-tailwind homepage for this website with topbar and footer. make it modern and minimalistic. include typewriter effect in homepage so give me bunch of lines, words that can be iterated through. include the typewriter "Define. Generate. Iterate." this as the fixed part and ""Fake user data..", 
 "Mock database in seconds..", "10,000 users in 2 clicks..", "Data of customized schema.."," these as changing phrases. also  include these lines -" Speed up development with dynamic test data. ","No more hard coded data, just mock it like a pro. ","  Design your schema & Get instant test data. ". The whole page should be of the same dark color including the header and footer.  the buttons to not have any color but borders. The text and button border color should be bright mixed diffused of many colors. The homepage should be of single page. Except for the footer and topbar the page should be divided into two sections. Design beautifully. Also change the text color into some different mix of  variants red-yellow-orange.
